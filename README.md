Underwater rugby time &amp; score app

PC / Mac desktop app, that connects to UWR (underwater rugby board ment for keeping scores, counting game time, penalties etc...) and shows needed info in the screen. UWR board is shown in picture below. The board has old serial port, so aten usb-to-serial converter was used to connect it to PC. Aten USB-serial-converter used can be found here: http://www.aten.com/global/en/products/usb-&-thunderbolt/usb-converters/uc232a/#.WdpH-ztx2po.

The app was developed to European championships in underwater rugby: http://www.cmas.org/news/the-european-championships-in-underwater-rugby-helsinki-finland-26.6.-1.7.2017. The showed data was integrated to live video taken from the games. Here's link to game videos: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1z_FJ2xJH6mZWFNNXVMVzBzNTA.
